# Examples

The `example/test.jl` script provides a starting point for understanding how to set up and run a basic simulation. 

Running the code typically consists of the following steps: initialize a small number of particles, define simulation parameters, and run the simulation for a set number of steps.

Here's a conceptual example of how to use the main module and run a simulation:

```julia
# Import necessary packages
using SelfPropelledVoronoi # The main package for the simulation
using StaticArrays # Provides SVector for efficient, statically-sized vectors 
using Random # Provides random number generation

# --- Define Simulation Domain and Particle Count ---
# N: Number of particles in the simulation
N = 100
# box_Lx: Length of the simulation box in the x-dimension
box_Lx = 10.0 
# box_Ly: Length of the simulation box in the y-dimension
box_Ly = 10.0 
# sim_box: Creates a SimulationBox object to store the dimensions of the 2D simulation domain. 
# This object encapsulates the geometry (Lx, Ly) and implies periodic boundary conditions are used by the simulation logic.
sim_box = SimulationBox(box_Lx, box_Ly)

# --- Define Particle Properties (VoronoiCells) ---
# These parameters define the physical characteristics and behavior of the simulated particles, 
# which are modeled as cells in a Voronoi tessellation.
# Each parameter is an array of length N, allowing for different properties for each particle if needed.
# The VoronoiCells struct groups these properties.

# P0: Target perimeter for each particle (Voronoi cell). 
# Cells will experience an elastic force resisting deviations from this preferred perimeter.
# units: length units, consistent with box_Lx, box_Ly.
P0 = 3.8 * ones(N) 

# A0: Target area for each particle (Voronoi cell). 
# Similar to P0, deviations from this preferred area will result in an elastic restoring force.
# units:  area units (length units squared).
A0 = 1.0 * ones(N)

# KP: Perimeter spring constant (or stiffness). 
# Determines the strength of the force resisting changes to the cell's perimeter. Higher KP means more resistance.
# units:  energy / length^2 or force / length.
KP = 1.0 * ones(N)

# KA: Area spring constant (or stiffness). 
# units:  energy / area^2 or force / area.
KA = 1.0 * ones(N)

# f0: Active force strength (or self-propulsion force magnitude). 
# The magnitude of the intrinsic force that drives each particle's movement. The direction is determined by the orientation of the particle.
f0 = 1.0 * ones(N)

# Dr: Rotational diffusion rate. 
# Controls the rate at which the orientation of particles changes randomly due to rotational noise.
# units: radians^2 / time 
Dr = 0.1 * ones(N)

# particles: Creates a VoronoiCells object to store the collective properties of all particles.
# The arguments correspond to target_perimeters, target_areas, K_P, K_A, active_force_strengths, and rotational_diffusion_constants respectively.
particles = VoronoiCells(P0, A0, KP, KA, f0, Dr)

# --- Define Simulation Parameters ---
# params: A ParameterStruct structure holding various global simulation settings and constants.
params = ParameterStruct(
    # Number of particles 
    N = N, 
    # Time step for the numerical integration of equations of motion. 
    dt = 0.001, 
     # Thermal energy, product of Boltzmann constant (kB) and Temperature (T). 
    # This term scales the magnitude of random forces due to thermal fluctuations
    kBT = 1.0,
    # Friction coefficient. Affects the mobility of the cells (the ratio of the force on the cell and its velocity)
    frictionconstant = 1.0, 
    # Depth of the layer used for handling interactions across periodic boundaries.
    # Particles within this distance from a boundary will interact with periodic images of particles 
    # from the opposite side of the simulation box. This value should typically be larger than a neighbor distance. If this is too small, the simulation may crash
    periodic_boundary_layer_depth = 2.5, 
    # If true, the simulation prints progress messages, warnings, or other information to the console.
    verbose = true, 
    # The SimulationBox object defining the domain (defined above).
    box = sim_box, 
    # The VoronoiCells object defining particle properties (defined above).
    particles = particles, 
    # A DumpInfo structure for controlling data output (e.g., saving simulation snapshots). 
    # Here, 'save=false' indicates that no data will be written to disk during this example run.
    dump_info = DumpInfo(save=false), 
    # A user-defined function that is called at the start of every time step during the simulation.
    # 'p', 'a', 'o' refer to the parameters, arrays, and output structs, respectively.
    # Useful for custom actions like live plotting, on-the-fly analysis, or data collection. 
    # Here, it's a no-operation (no-op) function, meaning nothing custom is done during simulation steps.
    callback = (p,a,o) -> nothing, 
    # Random Number Generator (RNG) instance.
    # Initializing it with a specific seed (1234 here) ensures that the sequence of random numbers generated will be the same every time the simulation is run with this seed. This is crucial for reproducibility.
    RNG = Random.MersenneTwister(1234) 
)

# --- Initialize Particle Positions and Orientations ---
# arrays: An ArrayStruct structure to hold the dynamic state variables of particles (e.g., positions, orientations) 
# that change over time during the simulation.
arrays = ArrayStruct(N) 
# Initialize positions and orientations randomly:
for i in 1:N
    # arrays.positions[i]: Stores the 2D position (x, y coordinates) of particle 'i'.
    # `SVector` (StaticVector) from the `StaticArrays.jl` package is used here. 
    # SVectors are stack-allocated, fixed-size arrays that can provide performance benefits for small vectors 
    # (like 2D or 3D coordinates) due to better memory locality and enabling certain compiler optimizations.
    # Positions are initialized randomly within the simulation box dimensions (box_Lx, box_Ly),
    # using the provided RNG from the params struct for reproducibility.
    arrays.positions[i] = SVector(rand(params.RNG)*box_Lx, rand(params.RNG)*box_Ly)
    # arrays.orientations[i]: Stores the orientation of particle 'i'. 
    # This is represented as an angle in radians (e.g., from 0 to 2*pi).
    # The orientation determines the direction of the self-propulsion force f0.
    # Orientations are initialized randomly between 0 and 2*pi using the provided RNG.
    arrays.orientations[i] = 2pi * rand(params.RNG)
end

# --- Initialize Output Structure ---
# output: An Output structure designed to store summary statistics 
# accumulated during the simulation (e.g., total potential energy, steps completed).
output = Output()

# --- Run the Simulation ---
# run_simulation!: This function executes the main simulation loop.
# It takes the simulation parameters (params), the initial state of particle arrays (arrays),  the output structure (output) and the total number of simulation steps to perform as input. The total simulation time will be dt * N_steps.
N_steps = 1000, 
run_simulation!(params, arrays, output, N_steps)
